      <p>
        My name is Lucas Agustin Vila. I am a student-athlete at Lynn
        University, currently pursuing a degree in Data Analytics while playing
        as a striker for the university’s men's soccer team. Originally from
        Argentina, I began my academic journey with a strong foundation in
        natural sciences and information systems, and have since transitioned
        into the fields of data and technology in the United States. With a
        background shaped by high-performance athletics and rigorous academic
        environments, I bring a unique combination of discipline, strategic
        thinking, and adaptability. My goal is to leverage data-driven
        decision-making and full stack web development skills to solve
        practical, real-world problems across industries. I am especially
        interested in the intersection of analytics, technology, and performance
        optimization — whether in sports, business, or digital innovation.

    <h2>IT professional experience </h2>
    <p>
      In my current role at Lynn University, I provide technical support to
      students, faculty, and staff, assisting with hardware, software, and
      network troubleshooting. I handle device setup, software installation, and
      connectivity to university systems, responding to support requests through
      email, in person, and via a ticketing system. I have also gained hands-on
      experience using Jira to assign, delegate, and track tickets, ensuring
      efficient issue resolution and team coordination. This position has
      strengthened my communication skills, especially when explaining technical
      solutions to non-technical users. Through this experience, I have developed
      a strong interest in transitioning into the tech industry and I am actively
      building the technical and analytical foundation necessary to grow within
      that field.
